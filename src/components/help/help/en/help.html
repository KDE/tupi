  <p class="title">Help Module</p>
<p class="paragraph">If you’re reading this paragraph, then
  you’ve found the <b>Help Module</b>. This is the third tab
  of the workspace and provides a small manual in which we hope to
  give you the information you need to start enjoying this program
  and creating your own animations.</p>
<p class="paragraph">On the right side of the workspace,
  you’ll see the table of contents. To go to a section or
  particular topic, just to click on the item that interests
  you.</p>

  development team. Together as a community, with your
  contributions, ideas and suggestions, we can turn this project
  into a professional tool that allows free birth to millions of
  pieces of animated art. But one step at a time, it’s time
  to <a href="first.html">make an example</a>.</p>
