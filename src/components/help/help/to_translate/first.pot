"We’re telling a story! You do have a story to tell don’t you? It’s the first "
"step in creating an animation project. Usually novices begin to draw on the "
"first frame of the <i>Animation Module,</i> without even having the "
"slightest and idea of what will happen in the final frame. This is "
"definitely not a good strategy for quality results. As with any project, "
"animation takes planning. Before you start drawing, stop and think for a "
"moment “What is my story?”"

"No matter how small your project, it is always worth investing a few minutes "
"to think about the details of your animation. Questions like “Who are the "
"characters?” “What is the perspective?” “Where are they?” “Where are they "
"going?” “How many scenes am I going to include?” The longer your animation, "
"the more care you should take with the answers to these questions."

"For professional animators, this planning results in what is known as a "
"script, which is nothing more than a written text that tells a story which "
"an entire team can understand and make into a reality. In this case, it’s "
"only you, but even though you are the only one who has to understand the "
"story, it’s still good practice to write out your story to organize and "
"prepare yourself and your thoughts for the future. When you think about your "
"script’s importance, think of the importance of plans for an architect or "
"sheet music for a musician."

"For our example, we’ve deliberately chosen something simple, we are going to "
"create a very simple animation of a butterfly moving through the scene "
"following a trajectory similar to the one in the following image:"

"The butterfly will appear from the left side of the screen and disappear off "
"to the right in a matter of a few seconds. That is all. Probably you are "
"thinking that this is too simple, that perhaps it seems a waste of your "
"time, but do not forget, you need to learn how to use the tools before you "
"craft a masterpiece. When you have acquired great skill, we hope you’ll tell "
"us about it and show us the fruits of your labour. It is important though "
"not to forget, as an artist, to plan your project before you start to "
"draw.<br> <br> Good, we now have ready a mini script for our example, so <a "
