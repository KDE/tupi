  <p class="title">Main Components</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Tupi</b> is a suite of tools for 2D
  animation created for children from 8-100 years old. When you
  think of <b>Tupi</b>, think of it as a toolbox full of different
  components, each designed for a specific task. Let’s take a
  look at each of the parts that make up the work environment, this
  really is a must before you start using <b>Tupi</b>.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Note:</b> <i>Because we are still in a
  beta phase of development, it is likely that some options and/or
  features are different within the interface or appear in
  different places. Much of the information found in this manual is
  subject to correction in future versions.</i></p>

  <p class="paragraph">The Following is a typical display of the
  running application:</p>

  <p class="paragraph">Now, let’s take a closer look at its
  components.</p>

    <li class="item">
      <b>Top Menu Bar:</b> this is the conventional menu located
      along the top of the window like you find in most programs.
      It is separated into categories <i>(File, Edit, Insert,
      Window,</i> and <i>Help</i>). All the main options that
      affect the whole program are here.

    <li class="item">
      <b>Project File Management Panel:</b> is composed of buttons
      associated with the task of managing project files such as,
      create a new project, opening an existing project, saving,
      saving under a new name and closing an open project.

    <li class="item">
      <b>Workspace:</b> this is the main area of the application,
      the space where you design, build and visualize your
      animations. The <i>workspace</i> is comprised of four tabs,
      each of which contains one of the following modules:

      <ul>
        <li class="item"><b>Animation Module:</b> this module is
        used to build the graphics of each frame which will appear
        in your animation. It is little more than a small vector
        graphics editor, very simple ... for now.</li>

        <li class="item"><b>Player Module:</b> This is an animation
        viewer that you can use at any time to give you an idea of
        how your animation is looking.</li>

        <li class="item"><b>Help Module:</b> This is the module
        that you are referring right now.</li>

        <li class="item"><b>News Module:</b> is a window directly
        onto our <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>
        account. |Here you can find the latest news on this
        project, including new releases, the functionality
        implemented in the development version, news, etc.<br>
        <br></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li class="item">
      <b>Left Sidebar:</b> In this component there are three
      buttons associated with different features of drawing in the
      workspace:

        <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 9.</b> Left Sidebar</p>
      </center>

      <ul>
        <li class="item"><b>Colour Palette:</b> This button
        displays a panel through which you can choose the colour or
        gradient you want to use when painting with any type of
        brush.</li>

        <li class="item"><b>Brush Properties:</b> This button
        displays a panel with the current properties of the brush,
        such as the size of it and some characteristics of the
        stroke.</li>

        <li class="item"><b>Object library:</b> This button
        displays a panel with the object management interface of
        the library associated with the project. If you have an
        object or a particular image you want to store and reuse in
        different frames of your animation, you can use this
        component.<br>
        <br></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li class="item">
      <b>Right Sidebar:</b> similar to the left, but contains
      buttons associated with the animation process.

      <ul>
        <li class="item"><b>Scene Manager:</b> This button displays
        a panel that allows the management of the scenes that make
        up an animation. If you don't yet know what a
        scene is, don’t worry, we’ll talk about it
        later.</li>

        <li class="item"><b>Exposure Table:</b> This button opens a
        side panel displaying the table of exposures that make up
        each scene. Although it sounds complex, this table is
        really just a list of frames on which you illustrate your
        animation. Through this component, you can control the
        layers and frames of your project. Do you know what a
        layer? Here is a simple definition: imagine you take a bit
        of red paint and cover a sheet of paper with the colour and
        let it dry, then apply on the same sheet a coat of green,
        wait a while and then apply blue. Although in the end, your
        paper will look like the last colour you used, really you
        know that there are other colours below. Think of each of
        these colours, as layers, that is, levels of paint that you
        define yourself over a frame. Layers are very useful to
        achieve certain effects and techniques which you can
        discover and practice later.</li>

        <li class="item"><b>Help Manual:</b> This button displays
        the manual you’re referring to now.<br>
        <br></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li class="item">
      <b>Bottom Bar:</b> on this region will find a stopwatch
      button, this is the option to activate the <i>Timeline</i>
      panel. This tool, well used by animators from other programs,
      allows you to manage layers and frames, as well as visualize
      how the pieces of your animation will unfold in real time.

  <li class="item"><b>Properties Panel:</b> This zone is created
    temporarily each time you click on one of the buttons are in
    the sidebars or at the bottom. Although the initial image
    <b>(Fig. # 5)</b>, the panel appears on the right side of the
    interface, depending on where is the button you choose, may
    appear on the left side or even in the bottom. If you go back
    to click on the button initially selected, then the properties
    panel is closed.<br>
    <br></li>
  <li class="item">
      <b>Status Bar:</b> located at the bottom of the program, this
      bar has only one purpose, that is to display the coordinates
      (x, y) of the mouse cursor as it moves over the
      <i>workspace</i> in the <a href="animation.html"><i>Animation
      Module</i></a>.
