"<b>Learn what <i>linguist</i> is and how it works.</b><br> <b>Tupi</b> is a "
"software application developed with the <i>Qt</i> library, which is written "
"in <i>C++</i>. The good news is you do not have to learn <i>Qt</i> or "
"<i>C++</i> to help translate. It is, however, important to note that "
"<i>Qt</i> is not just a library for development, but also includes several "
"additional tools that facilitate application development. One is "
"<i>linguist,</i> a simple program that is included in the installation of "
"<i>Qt</i> that allows you to create support for new languages for "
