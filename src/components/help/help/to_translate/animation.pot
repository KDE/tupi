"This is the module you will spend most of your time in when you are working "
"with <b>Tupi</b>. You know why? This is where you will build each frame of "
"your animation; every line of every character and every piece of the "
"scenario for which you want to tell the story.<br> In other words, if you "
"wanted to create an animation of a character walking down a street, this tab "
"is where you will design the character and each of the positions in which "
"it will appear as you move it."

"Think of the <i>workspace</i> as a blank canvas, the space available for the "
"design of each of the frames that will be part of the animation. There are "
"two ruler scales, one at the top and one the left. In the centre, there is a "
"rectangular white background, representing the dimensions of the frame, or "
"if you prefer, your “paper”. On the right side you willfind a dynamic panel "
"that contains the properties of whichever tool is selected at that time and "
"at the bottom, a small set of controls related to the <i>Workspace</i>.<br> "
"<b>Tip:</b> Anything which does not draw into the frame, will not be visible "

"activated or deactivated at will and <i>Onion Skin,</i> functionality that "
"allows you to make the current frame semi-transparent in order to see "
"drawings in previous and subsequent frames. We will delve more into the use "

"<b>Scene Manager</b><br> What is a scene? I’ll try to give a simple "
"definition: think of a movie or a TV commercial, I’m sure you’ve noticed "

"arranged to tell the story? These fragments are usually easily recognised by "
"changes in the position of the camera or the spectator’s point of view.<br> "
"Once this concept is clear, it’s easy to explain this component, through "
"this panel you will be able to create, modify or delete each of the scenes "
"that you include in your animation project.<br> <b>Tip:</b> It is important "

"what scenes you will develop and in what order you’re going to create them. "
