  <p class="title">Let’s start a project</p>

  <p class="paragraph">Okay,first it’s time to open
  <b>Tupi</b>. Whichever graphical environment you are working
  with, if you already have the program installed on your computer,
  you should look in the section <i>"Graphics"</i> in your main
  application menu:</p>

  <p class="paragraph">At this point, you have two options: Create
  a new project or open an existing one. As this is our first time,
  we will create a new project by clicking on the “New
  Project” icon.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">On the dialog box that appears, you can
  enter some basic information about the project; file name,
  author’s name, the dimensions we want to give our animation
  and the number of frames per second (FPS) with which to work
  initially.<br>
  For this example, we will simply fill in the first two fields and
  leave others with their default values.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Clicking the <i>OK</i> button, makes the
  workspace available to start our project. Our starting point is
  always the <i>Animation module</i> and more specifically, the
  first frame of animation. Okay, we’re ready to <a href="drawing.html">start drawing</a>!</p>
