    <p class="title">Let's see how is it looking</p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Okay, we have half the frames of our project
      completed. It's time to learn to use the <i>Player Module.</i>
      Needless to say there is no general rule about how many frames you
      create before making a preview of your project, this is another
      skill that develops from practice, in other words you choose. </p>
    <center>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <center><img src="./images/preview01.png"></center>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> <img src="./images/preview02.png"> </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>

      <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig #57.</b> Project preview from the Player module</p>
    </center>
    <p class="paragraph"> Additionally, note that performing a preview
      of your animation does not affect your project at all, therefore,
      you can access this module as many times as you want, giving you the chance
      to find out how comfortable you feel about the end result and to fix the issues 
      you consider awkward.<br>
      The preview interface is quite simple, so there is nothing to
      worry about. The <i>Control Panel</i> contains all the necessary
      buttons to play your animation, step by step or continuously. </p>

      <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig #58.</b> Control Panel of the Player module</p>
    </center>
    <p class="paragraph"> If you look at the bottom of the panel, you
      will find information about the project: <i>Name of the scene,</i>
      the <i>total number of frames</i> and the <i>number of frames
        per second (FPS),</i> this last option is editable and allows
      you to adjust the speed of your animation.
      The FPS value is directly proportional to the speed of the animation,
      as bigger it is, as faster the animation will be.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"> <b>Tip:</b> The <i>Loop</i> option is
      quite useful if your project has few frames and you want to check the 
      quality of the movement of the shapes. You can enable it whenever you want.</p>

    <p class="paragraph"> Okay, now it's time to continue drawing new
      frames following the routemap of your script. Return to
      the previous section, and make all the pending graphics. Now, for most of you
      maybe the fact of drawing objects and characters over and over again seems to
      be an exhausting task, and we are totally agree with you.
      That's the reason we are working on a feature called <i>"tweening"</i>,
      used to save a lot of time when you are illustrating.
      </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Did you finish all the frames you need? Do you like what
      you are watching in the <i>Player Module?</i> Well, then it's time to 
      <a href="video_file.html">create your first video file</a>!</p>
