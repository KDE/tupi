"<b>Tupi</b> is a suite of tools for 2D animation created for children from "
"8-100 years old. When you think of <b>Tupi</b>, think of it as a toolbox "
"full of different components, each designed for a specific task. Let’s take "
"a look at each of the parts that make up the work environment, this really "

"project. Do you know what a layer? Here is a simple definition: imagine you "
"take a bit of red paint and cover a sheet of paper with the colour and let "
"it dry, then apply on the same sheet a coat of green, wait a while and then "
"apply blue. Although in the end, your paper will look like the last colour "
"you used, really you know that there are other colours below. Think of each "
"of these colours, as layers, that is, levels of paint that you define "
"yourself over a frame. Layers are very useful to achieve certain effects and "
"techniques which you can discover and practice later."
