"Animation is an art. No, wait. Animation is a <i>fun</i> art. We can also "
"say that animation is a technique whereby you give life to characters or "
"objects, but the truth is, animation is much more than that... it’s miracle! "
"When we talk about animation, we should start by looking at our eyes. "
"Nothing miraculous there? Of course, there is... and the ability to generate "
"a sense of animation is part of our ability to see or more specifically how "
"we see. Seeing is science!"

"Imagine you have a mountain of photographs, now imagine that you begin to "
"see them, one by one, as fast as possible. Every time you focus on a photo, "
"your eyes capture the information and send it to your brain. Your brain in "
"turn, converts it into the signal that you see. I see a house, I see a boat, "
"I see my uncle!, and so on. You might think that seeing just means opening "
"your eyes, but each time you “look” at anything it takes a great exchange of "
"information between your eyes and your brain, to turn that into the image "
"that you receive. This process is not easy to perceive because it takes such "
"an extremely small space of time, fractions of a second."

"Now, let’s see what happens when you take the mountain of photographs and "
"you begin to quickly view them one by one. For each image that you place "
"before your eyes, your brain begins to make an interpretation of it, "
"however, since you keep replacing each image with a new one, if you do this "
"at the right speed, your brain is unable to interpret the whole picture "
"before it has to start to interpret the next image. When the flow of photos "
"is large enough and passes at high speed, your brain begins to mix the "
"information from an image with the previous and the next, creating the "
"sensation of movement. That’s when the magic happens and we can talk about "
"animation."

"It is estimated that the human eye is capable of distinguishing only around "
"24 images in a second if you try to view them one after another. If the "
"number of images is equal or greater than 24, then the eye begins to see "
"that the elements begin to acquire motion. Wait a minute. Does this mean "
"that a film is nothing but a huge pile of pictures that pass before my eyes "
"at breakneck speed? The short answer is yes! However, we must bear in mind "
"that a movie is something a little more complex, as it is audio-visual "
"content, which means that it also includes sound and a lot of technical "
"details that we’ll leave pending for later."

"In the world of animation, each image from which an animation is composed "
"known as a “frame”, so the speed at which a film is projected is measured in "
"frames per second (FPS) . The more frames you have in a second of "
"animation, the better the illusion of movement will be and the fewer you "
"have, the more the sense of flow will erode."

"<b>2D Animation:</b> This is a technique based on planes for the creation of "
"frames that will be part of the animation. Hey! wait a moment, what is a "
"plane? When you think of a plane, think of it as an uniform surface, similar "
"to a sheet of paper, a soccer field, the floor of your house or even think "
"of a wall. I know it sounds strange, but a plane is nothing more than a flat "
"surface. Now, in slightly more complicated terms, a plane is a workspace "
"where you have two dimensions to pan, if you wish, you can think of these "
"two dimensions as up-down and left-right. These two dimensions are those "
"from which we get the term 2D (two dimensions) that people use when talking "
"about 2D animation. Incidentally, historically it is one of the first "
"techniques of animation. If you look at the edges of a sheet of paper and "
"focus on the bottom and at the left edge, you’ll notice that they are like "
"two straight lines that meet in the lower left corner. These two straight "
"lines are those that determine the level on which you draw and are "
"technically known as axes (in mathematics, often calling them X axis and Y "
"axis). In short, when you think of 2D animation, think of a flat surface "
"made from the paths created by an artist either on paper or whether from a "
"computer program for 2D animation. Two good examples of this technique are "
"most TV series you can see on <a "
"href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon_Network\">Cartoon Network</a> as "
"well as all the <a "
"href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Classics\">classics of the "
"Walt Disney Company ®</a>. Let’s look at another example:<br>"

"<b>3D Animation:</b> This technique is a bit like the one above, except that "
"they no longer talk about two dimensions, but three. A simple way of "
"thinking is to think in 3D top-down, left-right and front and rear. "
"Therefore, we speak of three axes, in mathematics, often called the <i>X "
"axis</i>, <i>Y axis</i> and <i>Z axis</i>). Unlike 2D art, animation in "
"three dimensions can only be done through specialized computer programs "
"which are responsible for calculating everything you need to generate each "
"frame that makes up an animation. Under this technique, the creator is not "
"responsible for illustrating figures, but rather to model geometric objects "
"and then articulated structures so that they can move through each frame of "
"the scene under construction. 3D animation is much more complex than 2D "
"because the software focused on the subject must perform the calculations "
"for each point in space, which is part of each image. These estimates "
"include: colour, lighting and texture, among others. All this translates "
"into hundreds of thousands of mathematical calculations (sometimes "
"millions!) so muuuuuuuch work! Fortunately, the computer does it and not the "
"animator. The best examples of 3D animation you can find in movies are \"<a "

"href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_nemo\">Finding Nemo</a>\" and in "

"<b>Stop Motion:</b> This technique is based on playing with photographs. If "
"you have a digital camera, it is all you need to get started. The procedure "
"is very simple, basically it involves taking a series of pictures, one after "
"the other, of a scene while between each picture making small changes to "
"the objects in the scene. Complex? No, not at all... consider a simple "
"example! Take a ball or any object you want and place it on a table. Place "
"your camera in a fixed position pointing in the direction of the table and "
"make sure it can not move easily, this point is key for a successful "
"animation effect. Note that all the pictures we take, will be captured from "
"the same position and from the same angle. Now, take a first shot of the "
"ball in its original position, then move it in one direction, but only a "
"little and take another photo. Move it a little further in the same "
"direction you started with and take a picture again. Repeat this procedure "
"several times until the last picture is that of the ball on the edge of the "
"table. Okay, now look at the screen of your camera and begin to review all "
"the photos from first to last stepping to the next photo at the same rate. "
"You’ll notice how they seem to show the ball moving towards the edge by "
"itself. This is Stop Motion! Two very good examples of the technique of stop "
"motion you can find in the movies \"<a "
"href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpse_Bride\">Corpse Bride</a>\" and \"<a "
"href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas\">The "
