  <p class="title">Help with translations</p>

  <p class="paragraph">Due to the constant flow of new information
  from our development team and the need to communicate to the
  community in different languages, we decided to make a particular
  call to all people with skills to translate text from one
  language to another.<br>
  Among the types of documents that constantly need translation
  are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="paragraph">News and Announcements on our
    website</li>

    <li class="paragraph">Tutorials, Manuals and Examples</li>

    <li class="paragraph"> Language Support files for the
    <b>Tupi</b> program (required so that it can be used in English,
    Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, etc)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="paragraph">For news and tutorials, just simply contact
  us if you want to translate a particular piece of text or if you
  want to help but you don’t know what to tackle, we can assign
  something to you, we always have something needing
  translation.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">Language support, if you didn’t know, are
  the files that provide the ability of an application to print all
  its messages, menus etc. in a particular language. If you’re
  interested in making <b>Tupi</b> available in Chinese, Arabic,
  French or another language of your interest, then you’re in the
  right place to help.<br>
  In the case of language support files, you need to have some
  knowledge of the tools and processes we use to create and manage
  these files. Follow the instructions and you can become one of
  our most important translators:</p>

  <p class="paragraph"><b>Learn what <i>linguist</i> is and how it
  works.</b><br>
  <b>Tupi</b> is a software application developed with the
  <i>Qt</i> library, which is written in <i>C++</i>. The good news
  is you do not have to learn <i>Qt</i> or <i>C++</i> to help
  translate. It is, however, important to note that <i>Qt</i> is
  not just a library for development, but also includes several
  additional tools that facilitate application development. One is
  <i>linguist,</i> a simple program that is included in the
  installation of <i>Qt</i> that allows you to create support for
  new languages for <b>Tupi</b>.</p>

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #68.</b> <i>linguist</i>
    application</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">If you have <i>Qt</i> installed on your
  computer, you probably already have <i>linguist</i> installed.
  Look for the application on the main menu of your graphical
  environment, in the <i>Programming</i> section</p>

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #69.</b> Opening
    <i>linguist</i></p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">The raw material for this utility is a file
  with the <b>.ts</b> extension, from which you can translate all
  the messages that are part of <b>Tupi</b> into the language you
  want. The good news is that you do not have to start from
  scratch, because we already have one (<a href="http://www.maefloresta.com">tupi_es.ts</a>) on our website.
  Download it and rename it according to the language you want
  translated, for example if you want to create support for
  <b>Tupi</b> Italian, then rename the file as tupi_it.ts and
  <i>open it from the linguist program like this:</i></p>

  <center>
    <table>
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="../images/linguist03.png"></td>

        <td><img src="../images/linguist04.png"></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #70.</b> Opening a translation file
    (.ts)</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">Now, let’s look at the most important
  components of the program that we will use. The first is the list
  of contexts. This name sounds complex, but is nothing more than a
  list of groups of words. That is, each list item you see in the
  figure simply represents a group of words associated with that
  context.</p>

  <center>
    <img src="../images/linguist05.png">

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #71.</b> List of contexts</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">The next component is the list of words or
  phrases associated with a context. These words and phrases appear
  in <b>Tupi</b> and are what we translate. Each context can have a
  variable number of words or phrases to be translated. Regardless,
  all texts need to be translated.</p>

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #72.</b> List of words in a
    context</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">So far, we have located the names of the
  groups (contexts) and the list of words for each context. Now,
  let’s cover the most important tool, the translations
  form:</p>

    <img src="../images/linguist07.png">

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #73.</b> Translations form</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">Now let’s see in detail what fields we have
  to consider on the translations form:</p>

  <center>
    <img src="../images/linguist08.png">

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #74.</b> Translation form in
    detail</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">The box highlighted in <b><font color="#a90000">red</font></b> contains the word or phrase that we need
  to translate, in this particular case, the word <i>"Pen".</i> The
  <b><font color="#008400">green</font></b> box contains the
  underlined space where we put the translation. In this particular
  case of translation into Spanish: <i>"Pencil."</i><br>
  This is just one word, but for the whole process: Once you open
  the file for translation (e.g. <i>tupi_it.ts),</i> we select, one
  by one, all contexts <b><font color="#157e15">(1).</font></b> For
  each selected context, we will have to click on each of the words
  or phrases listed in the second column of the interface
  <b><font color="#1d5d8a">(2),</font></b> to translate it in the
  form located at the bottom <font color="#c81818"><b>(3).</b></font> Once we have gone through all the
  settings and there are no more words to translate, you have
  finished the task.<br></p>

    application <i>linguist</i></p>

  <p class="paragraph">Finally, you should save and send the file
  by mail to our development team for inclusion in future versions
  of <b>Tupi</b>.</p>
